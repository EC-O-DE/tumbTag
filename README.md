# TumbTag - Post your favorite tags in one click [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tumbtag-tumblr-easy-add-t/cmbakfeanhaniakabiiabhdjkhgbbdmp/related?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)
=======

#### Add a "Tags" button on the Tumblr dashboard

## Features:

- Post your favorite tags in **one click**
- Tags button fits with the **Tumblr's layout**
- Create/Update/Delet lists of tags **saved in the browser** (chrome.storage)

## How it works ?

When I wanted to post something on tumblr, I had to go through all my favorite tags (\#hashtags). Since I'm using **TumbTag**, I just have to click on one button and my tags are added.
