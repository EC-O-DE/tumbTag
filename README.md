=======

#### Make your life easier posting on Tumblr.

## Features:

- Create a list of tags saved in the browser (localStorage)
- Post the tags on your post in one click

## How it works ?

When I wanted to post anything on tumblr, I had to go through all my tags (\#hashtags). Not even a copy-paste worked, so I created TumbTag. This chrome extensions allows you to store your favorite tags and post in one click.
